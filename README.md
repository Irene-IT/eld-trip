## 🔎 What the Project Does

**ELD Trip** is a simple one-page website built according to a Figma design.  
This is my very first personal project, created to practice layout building and beginner-level JavaScript.

The site demonstrates:
- a responsive landing page structure,
- clean HTML/CSS layout,
- basic JavaScript scripts (form interaction).

## 💡 Why the Project Is Useful

This project is useful as:
- an example of a pixel-perfect implementation based on a Figma mockup,
- a starting point for beginners in frontend development,
- a template for learning and experimenting with HTML/CSS/JS.
